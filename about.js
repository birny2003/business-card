        My name is Aryeh Birnbaum. I am 21 years old and have been studying
        front-end web-development for the past seven months. Over that time, i
        have become more and more familiar with coding languages such as HTML,
        CSS, JavaScript and most recently, React. In my opinion, the best way to
        gain skills in this sector, is to keep on building new projects, no
        matter how basic they might be, as this really helps people to get into
        the habit of writing out the syntax in a more enjoyable way in which
        there is an end goal.
